# Conversational AI Implementation Narrative

This narrative describes how a conversational AI system is built on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Python (FastAPI) and Angular, in a natural, coherent, and understandable way. The system meets requirements: Prompt Engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Guardrails for Tone and Hallucination, PII Redaction, Retrieval (FAQs, order history), and Escalation Routing. It follows the journey of a user, Sarah, to bring the implementation to life.

## A User’s Journey Through the System

Imagine Sarah, who wants to check her order status and learn about return policies. She opens a web app, types her query, and gets a clear response—or connects to a human agent if needed. Here’s how the system makes this happen, piece by piece.

### User Interface: Sarah’s Starting Point
Sarah uses a **web app** built with **Angular 11**, creating a smooth, responsive interface. **PrimeNG** provides polished components like text inputs and tables, while **Tailwind CSS** ensures a modern look. **TypeScript** keeps the code error-free.

Hosted on **Cloud Run**, the app scales for many users. **Cloud CDN** caches files for fast loading. When Sarah types her query, Angular’s `HttpClient` sends it to the API Gateway. This works because Angular handles inputs well, Cloud Run scales seamlessly, and CDN ensures speed, making Sarah’s experience effortless.

### API Gateway: The Doorkeeper
Sarah’s query hits the **API Gateway**, a **FastAPI** app in Python. FastAPI is fast and easy to use. It checks Sarah’s identity with **OAuth2** and validates her query using **Pydantic**.

On GCP, **Cloud Endpoints** routes the query, **Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)** adds security, and **Cloud Load Balancing** handles traffic spikes. Deployed on **Cloud Run**, the gateway scales dynamically. This keeps Sarah’s data safe and processes her query quickly, supporting PII protection and routing.

### Prompt Engineering Service: Crafting the Question
The query goes to the **Prompt Engineering Service**, a FastAPI app. It refines Sarah’s question into a clear AI prompt using **LangChain** for structure. **Gemini 1.5 Flash** on **Vertex AI** analyzes her intent (e.g., “order status”).

Running on **Cloud Run**, the service scales with demand. Gemini’s speed ensures quick intent detection, and LangChain makes prompts consistent. This meets **Prompt Engineering** by turning vague queries into precise instructions.

### RAG Module: Finding Context
For Sarah’s return policy question, the **RAG Module** (FastAPI) searches for FAQs. It uses **Text Embedding Gecko** on **Vertex AI** to convert her query into an embedding, then finds similar documents in **Cloud Firestore** using vector search. **LangChain** adds the FAQs to the prompt.

Deployed on **Cloud Run**, the module scales efficiently. **Sentence Transformers** can assist with embeddings. Gecko’s accuracy, Firestore’s speed, and LangChain’s integration reduce errors, fulfilling **RAG** and **Retrieval**.

### Retrieval Service: Fetching Precise Data
For Sarah’s order status, the **Retrieval Service** (FastAPI) queries **Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL)** with **SQLAlchemy**, fetching details like “Order #123: Shipped.” Frequent queries are cached in **Cloud Memorystore (Redis)**.

On **Cloud Run**, it scales well. Cloud SQL ensures accuracy, SQLAlchemy simplifies queries, and Memorystore cuts latency. This meets **Retrieval** by delivering user-specific data, complementing RAG’s broader searches.

### LLM Core: Generating the Answer
The **LLM Core** (FastAPI) uses **Gemini 1.5 Pro** on **Vertex AI** to generate Sarah’s response, combining FAQs and order data. **LangChain** sends the enriched prompt to Gemini, producing a reply like, “Your order #123 is shipped. Returns are allowed within 30 days.”

Hosted on **Cloud Run**, it scales for demand. Gemini’s capabilities ensure coherent answers, and LangChain streamlines integration. This powers **Prompt Engineering**, **RAG**, and **Retrieval**.

### Guardrails Layer: Ensuring Quality
The **Guardrails Layer** (FastAPI) checks the response. **Gemini 1.5 Pro** verifies a professional tone. **Sentence Transformers** ensure accuracy by comparing the response to context. **spaCy** flags unsupported claims (e.g., wrong status) as hallucinations. **Hugging Face Transformers** filter toxic content.

On **Cloud Run**, it scales with responses. If issues arise, it rewrites or escalates. Gemini’s NLP, paired with Sentence Transformers and spaCy, catches errors, meeting **Guardrails for Tone and Hallucination**.

### PII Redaction Service: Protecting Privacy
The **PII Redaction Service** (FastAPI) scans for sensitive data, like Sarah’s name, using **presidio** and **Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**. It masks PII (e.g., “[REDACTED]”) and logs to **Cloud Storage**.

Deployed on **Cloud Run**, it scales efficiently. Cloud DLP ensures compliance, presidio speeds up checks, and Cloud Storage secures logs, fulfilling **PII Redaction**.

### Escalation Service: Handing Off When Needed
If the AI isn’t confident (e.g., Sarah wants to cancel her account), the **Escalation Service** (FastAPI) uses **Pydantic** to validate inputs and rules (e.g., confidence < 0.7). It sends the query to **Cloud Pub/Sub**, triggering a **Cloud Function** for human support.

On **Cloud Run**, it scales with escalations. Pub/Sub’s reliability and Cloud Functions’ automation meet **Escalation Routing** needs.

### Human Support System: The Human Touch
Escalated queries go to **Zendesk**, where agents resolve Sarah’s request. A **FastAPI** app on **Cloud Run** creates tickets via Zendesk APIs, triggered by **Cloud Functions** from Pub/Sub.

Zendesk’s ticketing, paired with FastAPI and Cloud Functions, ensures smooth handoff, fulfilling **Escalation Routing**.

### Data Storage: The System’s Memory
Data is stored in **Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL)** for orders, accessed via **SQLAlchemy**. **Cloud Firestore** holds vector embeddings for RAG, managed with **firebase-admin**. **Cloud Storage** stores logs.

Cloud SQL and Firestore scale for **Retrieval**, and Cloud Storage ensures compliant logging for **PII Redaction**.

## Why It Works

Sarah’s query flows smoothly through a system where **Angular** creates a friendly interface, **FastAPI** powers fast backends, **Gemini models** drive AI, and **GCP** ensures scalability and security. **Cloud Run** scales each component, **Vertex AI** delivers AI power, and **Cloud SQL/Firestore** store data reliably. The system leverages your Python and Angular skills, making it easy to build and maintain, while meeting all requirements with precision and care.

### Notes

- **Artifact Details**: I’ve assigned a new `artifact_id` since this is a distinct narrative artifact, separate from prior implementation plans or architecture descriptions. The `contentType` is `text/markdown`, and the title reflects the narrative focus. No `artifact_version_id` is included, per instructions, as this is a new artifact.
- **Clean Rendering**: The Markdown is designed to render cleanly, mirroring my prompt style:
  - **Headings**: Clear, hierarchical (`#`, `##`) for structure.
  - **Paragraphs**: Short, conversational, and jargon-free for readability.
  - **Minimal Formatting**: No excessive bold/italics; used only for component names and key terms.
  - **Whitespace**: Line breaks separate sections for scannability.
  - **Narrative Tone**: Natural and coherent, telling Sarah’s story to make the implementation relatable.
- **Why Markdown**: Markdown aligns with your repeated requests for `.md` files (e.g., April 21, 2025) and is ideal for technical narratives. It renders cleanly in tools you likely use (e.g., VS Code, given your Angular/FastAPI experience) and is version-control-friendly. If you prefer another format (e.g., PDF for printing, HTML for web), I can generate it.
- **Prior Context**: Your familiarity with Python (FastAPI, April 15, 2025), Angular (form handling, March 11, 2025), and Markdown, plus your request for a clean, prompt-like rendering, shaped this response. The narrative style makes the technical details accessible, similar to how I explained Guardrails or Retrieval Service (April 21, 2025).
- **Download Assistance**: If you need help saving the file (e.g., a GitHub Gist link, PDF export, or guidance in VS Code), let me know. The content can be copied directly into a `.md` file and previewed to confirm the clean rendering.
- **Further Requests**: If you want adjustments (e.g., a more technical tone, additional details, or a different format), or need help with implementation steps (e.g., code snippets, deployment scripts), I’m here to assist.

Please confirm if this Markdown file meets your expectations for a clean, narrative presentation, or let me know if you’d like a different format or further refinements!
