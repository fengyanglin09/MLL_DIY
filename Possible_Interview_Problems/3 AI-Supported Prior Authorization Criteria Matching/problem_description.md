### Project Summary:
This project aims to develop and implement an intelligent system that uses Artificial Intelligence to automate the process of matching prior authorization requests submitted by healthcare providers against the criteria and rules set by health insurance plans (payers). The goal is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the prior authorization process, reduce administrative burden, control costs, ensure medical necessity, and ultimately streamline access to care for patients.

### Potential Requests (Features/Functionalities)

These are the functionalities the AI-supported PA system would likely need to offer:
- **Prior Authorization Request Intake**:
  - Ability to receive prior authorization requests electronically from various sources (EHR systems, payer portals, APIs).
  - Parsing and extraction of relevant information from the requests (patient demographics, provider details, service/medication codes, clinical information, etc.).

- **Criteria Matching Engine**:
  - AI-powered engine to compare the extracted request information against the payer's specific prior authorization rules and guidelines.
  - Handling of complex criteria, including logical conditions, medical coding standards (ICD-10, CPT), and payer-specific policies.
  - Scoring or confidence levels for matches to indicate the likelihood of approval.

- **Automated Decision Support**:
  - Providing recommendations (approve/deny/needs further review) based on the criteria matching results and confidence scores.
  - Flagging requests that require human intervention due to complexity, exceptions, or high-risk factors.

- **Integration with Payer Systems**:
  - Seamless integration with Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems used by providers for submitting requests.
  - Integration with payer platforms for receiving requests and communicating decisions
  
- **Reporting and Analytics**:
  - Generation of reports on prior authorization request volumes, approval rates, turnaround times, and reasons for denials.
  - Analytics to identify trends, bottlenecks, and opportunities for process improvement.

- **Audit and Logging**:
  - Maintaining a comprehensive audit trail of all requests, decisions, and system actions for compliance and transparency.

- **User Interface for Review (Human-in-the-loop)**:
  - A user-friendly interface for human reviewers to access and review requests flagged by the AI or requiring manual assessment.
  - Ability for reviewers to view the AI's matching results, supporting documentation, and make final decisions.

    
- **Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement**:
  - Mechanism for capturing feedback from human reviewers on AI decisions to improve the matching engine's accuracy over time.
  - Continuous learning and model updates based on real-world data and outcomes.
