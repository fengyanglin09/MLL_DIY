### Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:
- Gathering and cleaning historical prior authorization data (requests and outcomes) from various sources.
- Structuring and formatting the data for training the AI model.
- Handling sensitive patient data with appropriate security and privacy measures.


### Foundation Model Integration and Fine-tuning:
- Selecting an appropriate pre-trained foundation model (likely a large language model or a specialized healthcare NLP model).
- Fine-tuning the model on the prepared prior authorization data to understand medical concepts, payer rules, and the context of the requests.
- Potentially training custom layers or adapting the model for the specific task of criteria matching and decision support.


### Developing the FastAPI Backend:
- Designing and building the API endpoints for receiving requests, processing data, interacting with the AI model, and communicating with other systems.
- Implementing the business logic for the criteria matching engine and decision support.
- Ensuring API security, scalability, and reliability.


### Frontend Development:
- Developing the user interface for providers to submit requests (potentially embedded within EHRs).
- Creating the interface for human reviewers to manage and adjudicate requests.
- Visualizing reports and analytics.
- Ensuring a user-friendly and efficient experience.


### Foundation Model:
- Considerations: The choice of foundation model depends on the specific nature of the prior authorization data (structured, unstructured text, or a combination), the complexity of the rules, and the desired level of reasoning.
- Potential Options on GCP (via Vertex AI Model Garden or other sources):
  - Large Language Models (LLMs) like PaLM 2 or Gemini: These could be fine-tuned to understand the context of medical requests and payer policies expressed in natural language. They might be particularly useful if a significant portion of the criteria is in free-text format.
  - Specialized Healthcare NLP Models: If available on GCP or through other providers, models specifically trained on medical text could offer a better starting point for understanding clinical information.
  - Transformer-based models: These architectures are generally effective for sequence-to-sequence tasks and understanding relationships in data.


### Fine-tuning Strategy:
- Fine-tuning the selected model on the historical prior authorization data, focusing on:
  - Understanding the structure and semantics of requests.
  - Learning the specific rules and criteria used by different payers.
  - Adapting to the language and terminology used in healthcare and insurance.
