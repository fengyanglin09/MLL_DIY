# AI-Supported Prior Authorization System: Architecture and Implementation

This document outlines the architecture, architecture diagram, and implementation details for an AI-supported Prior Authorization (PA) system. The system automates the matching of prior authorization requests submitted by healthcare providers against health insurance plan (payer) criteria, aiming to improve efficiency, reduce administrative burden, control costs, ensure medical necessity, and streamline patient access to care.

---

## Detailed Architecture

The AI-supported Prior Authorization system is designed to be modular, scalable, and compliant with healthcare standards like HIPAA and FHIR. It integrates with Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, payer platforms, and internal components to process requests efficiently. Below is a breakdown of the components and their interactions:

### 1. Prior Authorization Request Intake
- **Request Ingestion Layer**: A FastAPI-based REST API that receives prior authorization requests from EHR systems (via FHIR APIs), payer portals, or other external APIs.
- **Data Parsing Module**: Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract structured data (patient demographics, provider details, CPT/ICD-10 codes, clinical notes) from structured and unstructured request formats.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures the extracted data is complete and adheres to expected formats (e.g., valid CPT codes).

### 2. Criteria Matching Engine
- **AI Matching Engine**: A machine learning model (e.g., a combination of rule-based logic and a fine-tuned BERT model) that compares request data against payer-specific rules and guidelines.
- **Rules Database**: Stores payer-specific criteria, including logical conditions, medical coding standards, and policies, in a structured format (e.g., JSON or a relational database).
- **Confidence Scoring**: Assigns a confidence score to each match, indicating the likelihood of approval based on historical data and model predictions.

### 3. Automated Decision Support
- **Decision Logic Module**: Uses the confidence score to recommend actions (approve, deny, or flag for review). Complex cases or those with low confidence scores are flagged for human review.
- **Exception Handling**: Identifies high-risk or exceptional cases (e.g., rare conditions, experimental treatments) using predefined rules and thresholds.

### 4. Integration with Payer Systems
- **EHR Integration**: Uses FHIR APIs to pull additional patient data (e.g., medical history, recent labs) and push decisions back to the providerâ€™s EHR system.
- **Payer Platform Integration**: Communicates with payer systems via secure APIs to receive rules updates and send decisions, ensuring compliance with CMS timelines (e.g., 72 hours for expedited requests).

### 5. Reporting and Analytics
- **Analytics Engine**: Processes data to generate reports on request volumes, approval/denial rates, turnaround times, and denial reasons using a tool like Apache Spark.
- **Dashboard**: A web-based interface (built with React) displays trends, bottlenecks, and opportunities for improvement, accessible to administrators.

### 6. Audit and Logging
- **Audit Trail**: Logs all actions (request receipt, AI decisions, human reviews) in a secure database (e.g., Firestore) with timestamps and user IDs for compliance.
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Ensures adherence to HIPAA and CMS regulations through automated checks and audit reports.

### 7. User Interface for Review (Human-in-the-Loop)
- **Reviewer Interface**: A React-based UI where human reviewers can view flagged requests, AI recommendations, confidence scores, and supporting documentation.
- **Decision Workflow**: Allows reviewers to approve, deny, or request more information, with changes logged for audit purposes.

### 8. Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement
- **Feedback Capture**: Reviewers provide feedback on AI decisions (e.g., correct/incorrect, reasons for override) via the UI.
- **Model Retraining**: A pipeline (using Python and TensorFlow) retrains the AI model periodically with feedback data to improve accuracy over time.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Tracks model performance metrics (e.g., precision, recall) and triggers alerts if performance degrades.

## Implementation Details

Below are detailed implementations of key components using Python, FastAPI, React, and TensorFlow. The system assumes a cloud-based deployment (e.g., Google Cloud Platform) for scalability and compliance.

### 1. Request Ingestion and Data Parsing (FastAPI Backend)

The ingestion layer receives requests via a REST API, extracts relevant data, and logs the actions.

#### Code: `request_ingestion.py`

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Dict, Any
import firebase_admin
from firebase_admin import credentials, firestore
from transformers import pipeline
import logging

# Initialize FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# Initialize Firestore for audit logging
cred = credentials.Certificate("path/to/firebase-service-account.json")
firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred)
db = firestore.client()

# Initialize NLP pipeline for data extraction
nlp_pipeline = pipeline("ner", model="dslim/bert-base-NER")

# Pydantic model for PA request
class PARequest(BaseModel):
    patient_id: str
    provider_id: str
    service_code: str
    clinical_notes: str

# Audit logging function
def log_action(action: str, data: Dict[str, Any]):
    db.collection("audit_logs").add({
        "action": action,
        "data": data,
        "timestamp": firestore.SERVER_TIMESTAMP
    })

# Request ingestion endpoint
@app.post("/submit_pa_request")
async def submit_pa_request(request: PARequest):
    try:
        # Log incoming request
        log_action("request_received", request.dict())

        # Extract entities from clinical notes using NLP
        entities = nlp_pipeline(request.clinical_notes)
        extracted_data = {
            "patient_id": request.patient_id,
            "provider_id": request.provider_id,
            "service_code": request.service_code,
            "entities": entities
        }

        # Log extracted data
        log_action("data_extracted", extracted_data)

        return {"status": "success", "data": extracted_data}
    except Exception as e:
        log_action("error", {"error": str(e)})
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

#### Explanation
- **Purpose**: Handles incoming PA requests, extracts structured data using NLP, and logs actions for auditing.
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses `transformers` for NLP-based entity extraction from clinical notes.
  - Logs all actions to Firestore for compliance.
  - Validates and processes requests asynchronously with FastAPI.

---

### 2. Criteria Matching Engine (Python + TensorFlow)

The matching engine compares the request against payer rules and assigns a confidence score.

#### Code: `criteria_matching_engine.py`

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from typing import Dict, List
import json

# Load payer rules (mocked as JSON)
with open("payer_rules.json", "r") as f:
    payer_rules = json.load(f)

# Load pre-trained BERT model for matching
model = tf.keras.models.load_model("bert_matching_model")

# Criteria matching function
def match_criteria(request_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    service_code = request_data["service_code"]
    entities = request_data["entities"]

    # Prepare input for BERT model
    input_text = f"Service: {service_code}, Entities: {entities}"
    encoded_input = preprocess_input(input_text)  # Custom preprocessing function

    # Predict match confidence
    confidence = model.predict(encoded_input)[0][0]

    # Compare with payer rules
    for rule in payer_rules:
        if rule["service_code"] == service_code:
            if all(entity in entities for entity in rule["required_entities"]):
                return {"match": True, "confidence": float(confidence), "rule": rule}

    return {"match": False, "confidence": float(confidence), "rule": None}

# Decision logic based on match
def make_decision(match_result: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    if match_result["match"] and match_result["confidence"] > 0.9:
        return "approve"
    elif match_result["confidence"] < 0.5:
        return "flag_for_review"
    else:
        return "deny"
```

#### Explanation
- **Purpose**: Matches PA requests against payer criteria using a BERT model and rule-based logic.
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses TensorFlow to load and predict with a pre-trained BERT model.
  - Combines ML predictions with deterministic rules for robust matching.
  - Assigns confidence scores to guide decision-making.

### 3. Reviewer Interface (React Frontend)

The UI allows human reviewers to assess flagged requests and provide feedback.

#### Code: `ReviewerInterface.js`

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

const ReviewerInterface = () => {
  const [requests, setRequests] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch flagged requests
    axios.get('http://api.example.com/flagged_requests')
      .then(response => setRequests(response.data))
      .catch(error => console.error(error));
  }, []);

  const handleDecision = (requestId, decision, feedback) => {
    axios.post('http://api.example.com/submit_decision', {
      request_id: requestId,
      decision: decision,
      feedback: feedback
    })
      .then(() => alert('Decision submitted successfully'))
      .catch(error => console.error(error));
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Prior Authorization Review</h1>
      {requests.map(request => (
        <div key={request.id}>
          <h2>Request ID: {request.id}</h2>
          <p>Service Code: {request.service_code}</p>
          <p>Confidence Score: {request.confidence}</p>
          <button onClick={() => handleDecision(request.id, 'approve', 'Approved by reviewer')}>
            Approve
          </button>
          <button onClick={() => handleDecision(request.id, 'deny', 'Denied due to missing data')}>
            Deny
          </button>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ReviewerInterface;
```

#### Explanation
- **Purpose**: Provides a user-friendly interface for human reviewers to handle flagged PA requests.
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses React for a dynamic, responsive UI.
  - Integrates with the backend via Axios to fetch and submit decisions.
  - Allows reviewers to provide feedback for continuous improvement.

### 4. Feedback Loop and Model Retraining (Python + TensorFlow)

The feedback loop captures reviewer feedback and retrains the model.

#### Code: `feedback_loop.py`

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import pandas as pd

# Load feedback data
feedback_data = pd.read_csv("reviewer_feedback.csv")

# Prepare training data
X_train = feedback_data["input_text"]
y_train = feedback_data["correct_decision"]

# Load existing model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model("bert_matching_model")

# Retrain model with feedback
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32)

# Save updated model
model.save("bert_matching_model_updated")
```

#### Explanation
- **Purpose**: Implements a feedback loop to improve the AI model using reviewer feedback.
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses TensorFlow to retrain the BERT model with new data.
  - Processes feedback data in CSV format for simplicity.
  - Saves the updated model for deployment in the matching engine.

## Notes on Implementation

- **Scalability**: The system uses FastAPI for the backend, which is asynchronous and scalable. Firestore ensures scalable audit logging.
- **Compliance**: All data handling adheres to HIPAA, with encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256). Audit logs ensure transparency.
- **Continuous Improvement**: The feedback loop ensures the AI model improves over time, addressing concerns about AI accuracy in prior authorization (as noted in AMA surveys from web ID 5).
- **Integration**: FHIR APIs ensure seamless integration with EHR systems, aligning with CMS requirements for electronic prior authorization (web ID 1).
- **Analytics**: The dashboard provides actionable insights, helping identify bottlenecks as required by your project summary.

This architecture and implementation provide a robust foundation for an AI-supported PA system, balancing automation with human oversight for accuracy and compliance.
