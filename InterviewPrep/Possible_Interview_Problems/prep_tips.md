### Preparation Tips
- Practice RAG architectures: Know how to combine search with generation.
- Explore LangChain / LlamaIndex / Haystack: Useful for chaining together tools, documents, and LLMs.
- Think safety-first: Always mention redaction, content filters, human-in-the-loop when needed.
- Use diagrams: Sketch architecture flows quickly.
- Be practical: Emphasize constraints (cost, latency, hallucination, user feedback).
- Have a few reusable templates: For pipelines (RAG + memory + guardrails), write actions, tool-using agents.
