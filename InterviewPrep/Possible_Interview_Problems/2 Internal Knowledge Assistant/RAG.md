### Why Semantic Search in RAG?

#### we want to do semantic search in RAG because:

- **Understanding Meaning, Not Just Keywords**: The power of RAG lies in its ability to retrieve information that is conceptually related to the user's query, even if the exact keywords don't match. Semantic search uses the meaning of words and phrases to find relevant context.
- **Handling Natural Language**: Users often ask questions in natural, conversational language. Semantic search can understand the intent behind these questions far better than keyword matching.
- **Finding Nuance and Context**: Information often contains subtle nuances and contextual details. Semantic search can capture these relationships and retrieve more insightful and relevant documents.
- **Improving Answer Quality**: By retrieving more semantically relevant context, the language model in RAG has richer information to draw upon, leading to more accurate, comprehensive, and nuanced answers.
- **Overcoming Vocabulary Mismatch**: Different documents might use different terminology to describe the same concept. Semantic search bridges this gap.

#### how is stuff embedded and saved

1. **Embedding**: The text data (documents, passages, etc) is processed by a text embedding model. This model is a neural network trained to map words, phrases, and even entire sentences into dense, numerical vectors (lists of numbers). These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text. Text that is semantically similar will have vectors that are close to each other in the vector space. 
    -  **Think of it like this**: The embedding model transforms each piece of text into a coordinate in a high-dimensional space. Texts with similar meanings end up in nearby locations in this space.
2. **Saving to a Vector Database**: These generated embedding vectors, along with a pointer back to the original text data, are then stored in a vector database. Vector databases are specifically designed for efficiently storing and searching these high-dimensional vectors. They use specialized indexing techniques to quickly find the nearest neighbors (most similar vectors) to a query vector. 


#### what is used for searching?

1. **Query Embedding**: The user's query is also passed through the same text embedding model used to embed the documents. This generates a vector representation of the query's meaning.
2. **Similarity Search**: The vector database then performs a similarity search (also known as a nearest neighbor search). It calculates the distance (or similarity) between the query vector and all the document vectors stored in the database. Common distance metrics include cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and dot product
    - **Cosine Similarity**: This is a very common metric in semantic search. It measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. A cosine similarity of 1 indicates that the vectors are pointing in the exact same direction (highly similar), while a value of 0 indicates they are orthogonal (no similarity), and -1 indicates they are pointing in opposite directions (dissimilar). Â  
3. **Retrieval**: The vector database returns the document vectors that are most similar to the query vector based on the chosen distance metric. These retrieved vectors correspond to the text chunks that are semantically most relevant to the user's question. 
4. **Augmentation**: These retrieved text chunks are then passed to a large language model (LLM) along with the original user query. The LLM uses this retrieved context to generate a more informed and accurate answer. 

#### In Essence:
- **Embedding**: Converts text into vectors that capture meaning.
- **Vector Database**: Stores these vectors for efficient retrieval.
- **Semantic Search**: Finds the meaning-vectors in the database that are closest to the meaning-vector of the user's query.
